## What is a programming language?
- A programming language **acts as a bridge** between what **humans understand** and what a **computer understands**
- Early computers were **complex** and instructions would have to be in **written in binary code**, 0s and 1s
- This process was **slow**, taking days to program simple tasks
- Over time, new generations of programming languages have enabled people to become **faster** and **more efficient** at writing programs as they **resemble human language**
- Generations of programming languages can be split in to two categories:
    - **Low-level**
        - **First generation**
        - **Second generation**
    - **High-level**
        - **Third generation**

## Low-Level Languages

### What is a low-level language?
- A low-level language is a programming language that **directly translates to machine code** understood by the processor
- Low-level languages allow **direct control over hardware** components such as **memory** and **registers**
- These languages are written for **specific processors** to ensure they embed the correct machine architecture
#### First generation
- **Machine code** is a first-generation language
- Instructions are **directly executable by the processor**
- Written in **binary code**

#### Second generation
- **Assembly code** is a second-generation language
- The code is written using **mnemonics**, abbreviated text commands such as **LDA (Load), STA(Store)** 
- Using this language programmers can write **human-readable programs** that correspond **almost exactly to machine code**
- **One assembly language instruction** translates to **one machine code instruction**
- **Needs to be translated** into machine code for the computer to be able to execute it

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|Complete control over the system components|Difficult to write and understand|
|Occupy less memory and execute faster|Machine dependent|
|Direct manipulation of hardware|More prone to errors|
||Knowledge of computer architecture is key to program effectively|

## High-Level Languages

### What is a high-level language?
- A high-level programming language uses **English-like statements** to allow users to program with easy to use code
- High-level languages allow for clear **debugging** and once programs are created they are **easier to maintain**
- High level languages were needed due to the **development of processor speeds** and the **increase in memory capacity**
- **One instruction** translates into **many machine code instructions**
- **Needs to be translated** into machine code for the computer to be able to execute it
- Examples of high-level languages include:
    - **Python**
    - **Java**
    - **Basic**
    - **C+**

|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|
|Easier to read and write|The user is not able to directly manipulate the hardware|
|Easier to debug|Needs to be translated to machine code before running|
|Portable so can be used on any computer|The program may be less efficient|
|One line of code can perform multiple commands||
