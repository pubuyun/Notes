## Analysis
- The analysis stage of the program development life cycle is to **precisely understand the problem** the program is intended to solve
### Abstraction
> [!def] removing unnecessary details, and focus on the essential components.
### Decomposition
> [!def] the process of breaking down a large problem into a set of smaller problems

> components: inputs, processes, outputs, storage

Decomposing a problem requires developers to think about four component parts:
- **Inputs**: data entered into the system
- **Processes**: subroutines and algorithms that turn inputs and stored data into outputs
- **Outputs**: data that is produced by the system, such as information on a screen or printed information
- **Storage**: data that is stored on a physical device, such as on a hard drive or in memory whilst the program is running
### Identification of the problem
### Identification of the requirements

## Design
> [!def]  using techniques to come up with a blueprint for a solution
### Structure diagrams
> The structure diagram shows the ***top-down*** design of a ***computer system*** in a ***hierarchical*** way, in a ***diagrammatic**** form, with each level giving a more detailed ***breakdown** of the system into ***sub-systems***.

### Flowcharts
> A flowchart is _a visual tool that uses **shapes** to represent different functions_ to describe an algorithm.
## Coding
- Developers begin programming **modules**  in a **suitable programming language** that works together to provide an overall solution to the problem
## Testing
> [!def] *Iterative testing*
> modular tests are conducted, code amended, test repeated until the module performs as required
