### **The House On the hill**

The storm had raged(愤怒) for days, an unrelenting force battering殴打 the island with rain that stung刺痛 like needles and wind that howled嚎叫 like a lion's roar. I had watched from my rented attic room, waiting for my opportunity. Tonight, the skies had cleared just enough, the moon casting a sickly light upon my destination—the House.

The police had sealed it off, warning of disappearances and madness, but I sought something greater—glory, knowledge, proof that the supernatural existed beyond whispers and folklore.

I stepped past the rusted barrier, my boots crunching against the soaked gravel. The lock was easy to pick, and the door opened with a long, drawn-out冗长的 creak. My bag held the essentials: weapons, food, water, a flashlight, and most importantly, this journal—to keep my mind tethered束缚 to reason.

As I crossed the threshold, the air changed. **Thick. Stale. Wrong.**

#### **Diary Entries**

**Entry 1** - The Descent

I had barely walked ten feet inside when the floor gave way beneath me. Not collapsing—melting. It swallowed me, and I fell, not onto solid ground, but into a place that should not be.

The corridors stretch endlessly, yellowed wallpaper peeling like rotting flesh. A buzz fills the air, the droning hum of unseen lights that cast shadows in places they should not reach. I have marked the wall with my knife. I must map this place, find an exit.

---

**Entry 2** - Sleepless

Time is meaningless here. I tried to sleep, but the walls _breathe_. They expand, contract—watch. I swear I heard my own voice whispering from the vents, repeating my thoughts a second too late.

My flashlight flickers. My food remains untouched. Hunger gnaws at me, yet I dare not eat. The air itself feels... full, as if I am being _fed_ something unseen.

---

**Entry 3** - The Smiling Thing

I saw it today. A figure in the dark, its eyes white orbs reflecting my light. Teeth too many, stretching from ear to ear, frozen in unnatural glee.

It did not move, only watched.

I kept my gaze locked upon it and backed away, slow as the dead. The moment I blinked, it was closer.

I ran.

---

**Entry 4** - The Hungry Dark

The corridors shift now. My marks vanish. I hear my own footsteps echo back, delayed, wrong.

A door appeared today—red, old, pulsing like diseased flesh. I did not open it, but the handle turned _on its own_. I fled before it could show me what lay beyond.

---

**Entry 5** - I Am Not Alone

It speaks.

Not in words, but in thought. It _knows_ me. It wants me.

I saw my own reflection today, but it did not move as I did. It smiled.

---

### **Final Record**

The police found nothing but my journal and my clothing, scattered at the house’s entrance, as if I had been stripped from existence in the blink of an eye.

The last words scrawled in my journal were almost illegible, written in a shaking hand:

**“It is inside me now.”**
