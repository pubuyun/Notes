In this essay, I'll explore how Priestley presents Sheila as a character who changed in the Inspector calls. Sheila is portrayed as a young and pretty girl who represents the younger generation and shifting thoughts. Living in a time where WWI is about to happen with dramatic change in society, Sheila has more empathy on working class and more socialist thoughts than Birling's. In _An Inspector Calls_, Priestley uses Sheila's childish and naive at first comparing at her mature and independence after to show the change of Sheila.

Firstly, Sheila is childish at the start of the play, using "mummy", which reflects her immaturity and dependence on her parents. Moreover, she wants her mother's approval for her new ring, which means that she can't make her own decisions.

However, after the Inspector points out her responsibility in Eva Smith's death, she changes her attitude and starts to be more mature. For example, in "No, it's really... it was my own fault," which is the first time that one of the Birlings has taken up responsibility, and helps the audience know how she changed, also foreshadowing that the whole Birling family leads to Eva's death.

*Gerald’s unfaithfulness further accelerates Sheila’s transformation.*[new idea]() After she realizes her responsibility, she turns to think on the inspector's side, criticizing Gerald. For example, "When did you get to know her? Was it after she left Milliards? … began a different sort of life?... were you?" "Yes, of course you were." *reveals her growing confidence and moral independence, as she moves from being passive to actively confronting him, also representing the growing independence of women, leading to gender equity.*[better expression]

*Her transformation from a sheltered, naïve girl to a morally aware young woman demonstrates the hope Priestley places in the younger generation to learn from their mistakes and challenge the complacency of their elders.*[transition] Her transformation from a naïve girl to a mature and socially aware woman shows Priestley's hope for a more responsible and socialist society.



 "you’ll be marrying at a very good time" and suggests that "it’ll be an even better time"
 这反映了伯林的傲慢和对世界现实的盲目。普里斯特利用这个来表明资本家阶级对他们的未来过于乐观，忽视了灾难的警告信号。观众知道即将爆发的世界大战和大萧条，他们可以看出伯林的言论有多么错误，这使得他的演讲成为戏剧性讽刺的源泉。
 伯林将矿工罢工描述为“胡言乱语”"fiddlesticks"，并向观众保证“最糟糕的时期已经过去”。他对劳工运动和日益增长的工人骚乱的漠视表明了他的傲慢和对英国正在发生的社会变化的缺乏了解。普里斯特利利用伯林的无知来展示资本主义雇主的冷酷无情，他们优先考虑利润而不是工人权利。这很讽刺，因为观众知道，在戏剧发生后的几年里，劳工罢工和社会动乱将会加剧。
 也许伯林最大的错误是他自信地断言战争是不可能发生的。他将对国际紧张局势的担忧，尤其是英国和德国之间的紧张局势，视为“无稽之谈”！并坚称“德国人不想打仗”。这是**戏剧性讽刺**的一个例子，因为观众在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战后观看了这部戏剧，知道战争迫在眉睫。普里斯特利利用伯林的失误来揭露上层阶级对全球政治的理解是多么的脱节和天真。
 伯林声称“我们雇主终于走到了一起，确保我们的利益——以及资本的利益——得到适当的保护”，这说明了上层阶级如何寻求保护他们的权力和财富，往往以牺​​牲他人为代价。伯林的演讲表明，资本主义精英拒绝承认未来的变化和挑战，最终导致他们的垮台。
 强调了傲慢、自满和无知在社会和全球挑战面前的危险。这些缺陷使伯林成为资本主义失败的象征，促使普里斯特利在《探长来访》中对阶级分化和社会责任进行了更广泛的批判。
