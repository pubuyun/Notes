## Market Failure
> [!def] Market failure
> **misallocation** of resources

*Misallocation*: Where resources are not used to maximise society's *welfare*
> will happen if objectives of market participants conflict
### Complete Market Failure
> [!def]
> There is no market available for a good which society regards as desirable

> *Output is 0*

### Partial Market Failure
> [!def]
> A market is available but the output cannot maximize social welfare

> supply is higher/lower than demand

#### Monopoly
> Monopolists seek to increase prices by restricting output
> Less is produced than under a productively efficient, competitive market outcome

Lead to *Market Failure*
## Private Costs&Benefits
> _direct costs to the producer/consumer for **producing/buying the good or service**_
> benefits of production and consumption enjoyed by a firm, individuals, or government.
## Externality
> [!def]
> cost/benefit of production incurred by third parties which are not considered by individual economic agents 

> [!def] Imperfect Information
> Economic agents may poorly estimate the private costs and benefits of a good
### Merit goods
> [!def] 
> goods that will create positive spillover effects in an economy
> positive externality

> A good which is underprovided in a market.
## Social costs/benefits
> Total social cost = private costs + external costs
> Total social benefits = private benefits + external benefits
## Economic use of resources
If *Total social benefit* > **Total social cost**
Economic welfare can be improved by *encouraging* more production and consumption.
If *Total social benefit* < **Total social cost**
Economic welfare can be improved by *reducing* production and consumption.

## Private/Public Goods
### Excludability
> [!def]
> The owners of a good have property rights which allows them to prevent others consuming their good
### Rivalry
> [!def]
> Consumption of a good reduces the amount of the good that others can consume

*Private goods*: Excludability and Rivalry
*Public goods*: Non-Excludability and Non-Rivalry

> The market provision of public goods is often prevented by free-riders
> public goods are causes of market failure as 

**free-rider problem** is a type of market failure that occurs when those who benefit from resources and public goods do not pay for them or under-pay.
## Solution
> [!def] State provision
> when a nationalised industry is the main provider of a good or service
