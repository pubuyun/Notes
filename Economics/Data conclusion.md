### **1. Partial Market Failure**
The data suggests that shared bicycles experience **partial market failure**, where the output level does not maximize social welfare.

- **Surplus?**
    - 74.77% of respondents believe there are **too many** shared bicycles on the streets.
    - This indicates that supply **exceeds demand**, leading to inefficient resource allocation.
In conclusion, the shared bikes has **uneven distribution** rather than an absolute excess in supply. This imbalance can be attributed to two key factors:
1. **Low user activity in certain areas**
2. **Operational inefficiencies**

### **2. Negative Externalities**
Negative externalities arise when third parties bear costs not reflected in the market price. The survey identifies major external costs:
- **Congestion on pedestrian paths (71.03%)**
    - Shared bikes occupy sidewalks, **reducing space for pedestrians** and causing inconvenience.
- **Vandalism & misuse (46.73%)**
    - Uncontrolled dumping and destruction increase the **social cost of maintenance**.
Since these external costs are not reflected in the pricing mechanism, users are **not incentivized to use bikes responsibly**, leading to inefficient allocation.

### **3. Imperfect Information – Users Misjudging Costs & Benefits**
Users may not fully account for the **true costs of using shared bikes**:
- **86.92% have encountered inconveniences**, yet 74.77% **refuse to pay extra** for safety improvements.

This **misjudgment of private costs** leads to overuse in some areas and underuse in others.
### **4. Free-Rider Problem – Public Goods & Government Responsibility**
Shared bikes exhibit **some characteristics of public goods** (though not fully non-excludable), leading to **free-rider issues**:
- **36.45% blame bike companies, while 32.71% blame users** for problems like vandalism and improper parking.
- Since responsibility is diffused, **users do not feel obligated** to properly maintain or park bikes.
This aligns with the **free-rider problem**, where individuals use the service **without contributing to its upkeep**.
### **5. Solutions – Internalizing Externalities**
To correct these failures, the survey suggests solutions aligned with **government intervention and market-based policies**:
- **Designated Parking Zones (76.64%)**
    - **Regulation** to control overuse and reduce congestion.
- **Recycling Programs (56.07%)**
    - **Internalizing external costs** of waste and environmental impact.
- **Financial Penalties (52.34%)**
    - **Monetary disincentives** to curb misuse and vandalism.
- **Collaboration with Government (64.49%)**
    - Suggests that state provision or **subsidization** may be required.
