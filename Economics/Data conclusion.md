### **1. Partial Market Failure**
The data suggests that shared bicycles experience **partial market failure**, where the output level does not maximize social welfare. ![[ae5fd80ebf3745ce0cffc6150e95063.png]]
- **Surplus?**
    - 74.77% of respondents believe there are **too many** shared bicycles on the streets.
    - This indicates that supply **exceeds demand**, leading to inefficient resource allocation.
In conclusion, the shared bikes has **uneven distribution** rather than an absolute excess in supply. This imbalance can be attributed to two key factors:
1. **Low user activity in certain areas**
2. **Operational inefficiencies**
### **2. Negative Externalities**
Negative externalities arise when third parties bear costs not reflected in the market price. The survey identifies major external costs:
![[c6ae9c7d8b2d8216068506a87df0902.png]]
- **Congestion on pedestrian paths (71.56%)**
    - Shared bikes occupy sidewalks, **reducing space for pedestrians** and causing inconvenience.
- **Vandalism & misuse (45.87%)*    - Uncontrolled dumping and destruction increase the **social cost of maintenance**.
Since these external costs are not reflected in the pricing mechanism, users are **not incentivized to use bikes responsibly**, leading to inefficient allocation.
### **3. Imperfect Information – Users Misjudging Costs & Benefits**
Users may not fully account for the **true costs of using shared bikes**:![[e29a949f6355cc4e84b7a7ab269c20b.png]]![[96785704ba76f1e8aba8133b5f9d385 1.png]]
- **86.92% have encountered inconveniences**, yet 75.23% **refuse to pay extra** for safety improvements. This **misjudgment of private costs** leads to overuse in some areas and underuse in others.
### **4. Free-Rider Problem – Public Goods & Government Responsibility**
Shared bikes exhibit **some characteristics of public goods** (though not fully non-excludable), leading to **free-rider issues**:

This aligns with the **free-rider problem**, where individuals use the service **without contributing to its upkeep**.### **5. Solutions – Internalizing Externalities**To correct these failures, the survey suggests solutions aligned with **government intervention and market-based policies**:![[d71a081894bf4d0f12166079b4e2ef1.png]]
### **5. Solutions – Internalizing Externalities**
To correct these failures, the survey suggests solutions aligned with **government intervention and market-based policies**:
- **Designated Parking Zones (76.64%)**
- **Government Regulation** to control overuse and reduce congestion by government (65.14%)
