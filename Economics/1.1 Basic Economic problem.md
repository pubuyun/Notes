## Wants and Needs

> **Want**: what people want, unlimited
> **Need**: basic needs, e.g.: food, water, security, shelter

## Goods and Services

> **Services**: activities, intangible
> **Goods**: physical, tangible
### Economic Goods
-  Goods have a price, can obey laws of economics. (means they are **scarce**)
- Require *factors of production* to create. Because they need *FOP*, the cost of the *FOP* can be used to determine the price.
- Have **opportunity cost**.
### Free goods
- **No FOP required**, means no need for production, already available.
- Because the *FOP* is not required to produce this good, it’s challenging to assign a price or an opportunity cost.
- **It depends on**
- This is “not” something that is free
- “no price” or difficult to price
- e.g. air,  forest, sea


## Basic economic problem

> [!def] *Scarcity*: Infinite(Unlimited) wants + Finite(Limited) resources

> [!def] The situation of scarcity of resources can't satisfy everyone's needs and wants.

## Economic Agents
Scarcity -> choices -> **what, how, for whom** to produce

**individuals**: maximise **utility**
**firms**: maximise **profit**
**governments**: maximise **welfare**
## Opportunity cost
> [!def] the next best alternative that is sacrificed/forgone in order to satisfy the other
### sectors of industry
> *Primary* (Agrarian)
> *Secondary* (Industrialised)
> *Tertiary* (Developed/Services)
### chain of production
- the *Value Adding* process
- the *Transformation* process


[^fop]:: Factor of production
