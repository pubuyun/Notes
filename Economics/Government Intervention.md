## Indirect taxation
> aimed of reducing demand for demerit products
> can be shifted or passed on

> [!def] a [tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax "Tax") that is levied upon goods and services before they reach the customer who ultimately pays the indirect tax as a part of market price of the good or service purchased.

### Advantage

### Disadvantage
price inelastic - price increase will have little impact on the consumption level of many people
regressive, so will have a greater impact on low income earners than high income earners

$$ \text{Tax revenue} = \text{Tax Value} \times \text{New Quantity}$$
## Passed on
If the *co-efficient of PED* > 1, then most of the burden of an indirect tax will be absorbed by the supplier
If the *co-efficient of PED* < 1, then most of the burden of an indirect tax will be passed on to the final consumer

## Subsidies
> [!def] 
> provide subsidies to *encourage the consumption* of certain goods and services.

## Rules & regulation
> *limit* harm from negative externalities

### Advantages
> Consumption of the good or service may be reduced
> *Awareness* of the negative impacts of *demerit* goods can help to change the behaviour of people in the long term
> Awareness of the positive impacts of consuming *merit goods* is raised
### Disadvantage
> cause *underground markets* to provide the good or service at a very high price

## Privatisation and Nationalisation
- *Privatisation* is the transfer of the ownership of assets from the public sector to the private sector
- *Nationalisation* is the purchase of private sector assets by the government

### Advantages
> Improved efficiency
> Lack of political interference
> Increased competition
> Government will raise revenue from the sale
### Disadvantages
> monopoly
> trade-off
> still need government intervention

*non-rival*: once consumed, it is still there for consumption by another
*non-excludable*: once provided, it is not possible to prevent people from using it
**Free rider problem**: if non-excludable, then nobody will pay for it

## Direct provision
>[!def] is when the government decides to provide goods and services itself

*examples:* public goods, merit goods
justification for direct provision are based on the grounds of *Equity*
### Advantages
> resource allocation improves due to reduction of market failures, such as public goods
> No price exclusive, which is good for equality
### Disadvantages
> Opportunity cost + tax burden
> wasteful and inefficient, not able to innovate
> private sector might be ignored, which would have complement the public services
> shortage
