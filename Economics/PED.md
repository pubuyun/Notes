If demand is relatively *elastic*
**a small change** in *price* cause relatively **large change** in *demand*
If demand is relatively *inelastic*
**a small change** in *price* cause only **small change** in *demand*

## PED (Price Elasticity of Demand)
$$\text{PED} = \frac{\%\text{change in quantity demanded}}{\%\text{change in price}} = \frac{\Delta Q_{d}}{\Delta P}\times \frac{P_{0}}{Q_{d0}}$$
$$\%\text{change in quantity demanded} = \frac{\text{change in quantity}}{\text{original quantity}} \times \frac{1}{100}$$
$$\%\text{change in price} = \frac{\text{change in price}}{\text{original price}} \times \frac{1}{100}$$
> [!def] 
> How ***responsive*** consumer demand is to a change in price, and therefore how revenues may respond following a change in price

> [!def] Price elastic
> A product will be *price elastic* if $\ \text{PED} > 1$
### Example
Old fare *$2*, number of passengers *50*, total revenue $125
New fare *$2.5*, number of passengers *30*, total revenue $100
$$\%\text{change in price} = \frac{\$0.5}{\$2.00} = 25\%$$
$$\%\text{change in passenger numbers} = \frac{20}{50} = 40\%$$
$$\text{PED} = \frac{40\%}{25\%} = 1.6 > 1$$
