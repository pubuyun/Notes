## Ionic bonding
> [!def] *metal* atoms react with *non-metal* atoms

> - Metal atoms **lose**, non-metal atoms **gain** their *outer electrons* to form ions
> - The positive and negative ions are held together by strong **electrostatic forces of** **attraction** between **opposite** charges
### Ionic bond
> [!def] The force of attraction hold ionic compounds together
### Examples
$$Na^+ + Cl^- \to NaCl$$
$$Mg^{2+} + O^{2-} \to MgO$$
### Lattice structure
- Ionic compounds have a **giant lattice** structure (**no molecule** because it has no units)
- the atoms are arranged in an **ordered** and **repeating** fashion

### Properties
- They have **high** melting and boiling points
- The **greater** the *charge* on the ions, the **stronger** the *electrostatic forces* and the **higher** the *melting point* will be
> - *good* conductors of electricity in the **molten** state or in **solution** 
> - *poor* conductors in the **solid state

## Covalent Bonding
> [!def] **pairs** of electrons are **shared** between atoms
> 
- Only **non-metal** **elements** participate in covalent bonding
- each atom gains a **full** **outer** **shell** of electrons
- Covalently bonded substances may consist of small molecules or giant molecules
- When two or more atoms are **covalently** bonded together, we describe them as ‘**molecules**’

### Examples
$H_{2}O$
$CH_{4}$
$NH_{2}$
$H_{2} \ O_{2} \ Cl_{2}$ - *single bond*

## Metallic bonding
> [!def] the strong force of **attraction** between the positive metal ions and the delocalised electrons
- Metals consist of **giant** structures
- Within the metal lattice, the atoms lose their outer electrons and become positively charged metal **ions**
    - The outer electrons no longer belong to any specific metal atom and are said to be **delocalised**
    - This means they can move freely between the positive metal ions and act like a _“sea of electrons”_

### Properties

- **high melting and boiling points** 
    - strong electrostatic forces of attraction which needs lots of energy to be broken 
- Metals are **good conductors of heat and electricity** 
    - The *delocalised* electrons are free to move and carry a charge through the whole structure 
- Most metals are **malleable**(opposite. *brittle*)
    - This means they can be hammered into shape
    - This is because the atoms are arranged in layers which can slide over each when force is applied
