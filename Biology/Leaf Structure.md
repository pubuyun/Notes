## Structure
![[Pasted image 20241111152710.png]]
### Mesophyll
#### Palisade Mesophyll (栅栏状叶肉)
- Tall, narrow, stacked upright, tightly packed - *maximize* surface area
- Contain *many* chloroplasts - main function is *photosynthesis*
- Close to the top of the leaf, so they get plenty of sunlight
#### Spongy Mesophyll (海绵状叶肉)
- Also contain chloroplasts
- Not as tightly packed with air spaces between them - let CO2 diffuse

### Cuticle , Upper Epidermis, Lower Epidermis
*Epidermis* - Outer skin
#### Upper Epidermis
- Tightly packed to avoid water escaping
- *No* chloroplast, relatively transparent - let light pass through to mesophyll payer
- Secrete cuticle (分泌角质层)

#### Lower Epidermis
- openings on the lower epidermis called ***stomata***(pl. *stomata*, s. *stoma*)
- *stomata* are surrounded by a pair of *guard cells* which can open and close.
- Stomata allow diffusion of CO2 and O2 in and out; and water vapour out;

#### Cuticle
- *Not* a cell
- a waxy *substance* that is thin, transparent, waterproof
- protection

### Vascular bundle
- includes *xylem* and *phloem* for **transport**
## Features
*Thin*: Sunlight can pass through
Helps CO2 reach all cells quickly by diffusion
*Big surface area*: Large amount of sunlight fall onto leaf
Increase rate of diffusion of CO2

## Practical
### Test a leaf for presence of starch
1. Boil leaf in water :*to kill leaf cells*
2. boil again in ethanol: *for chlorophyll to leave leaf, chlorophyll dissolves in alcohol*
3. Rinse leaf in water: *to soften the leaf*
4. Spread leaf out, add iodine solution, if turns blue-black, starch is present
### Test for the necessity of light, chlorophyl, and CO2
- *Light*: cover leaf partly with black paper, then test starch. Parts covered yellow brown so no photosynthesis happened.
- *Chlorophyll*: variegated leaf, only parts that are green show starch presence
- *CO2*: use $KOH$ to remove $CO_{2}$ from atmosphere, if no $CO_{2}$, no starch present
- *De-Starching* means putting a plant in the dark for a few days, so it uses up all starch storage. Do this before the experiment to make sure all starch tested are made during the experiment
- Hydrogen-carbonate indicator: *purple*: no CO2, *orange/red*: atmospheric CO2, *yellow*: high CO2
- Measuring rate of photosynthesis
	- Aquatic plant makes oxygen bubbles when photosynthesis
	- Count bubbles made
	- *Improvement*: collect gas made with a syringe OR an inverted measuring cylinder in water
