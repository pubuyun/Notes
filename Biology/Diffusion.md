## Particle Theory
Everything is made of particles
Particles are always randomly moving(Brownian motion) and have kinetic energy

## Diffusion in Biology
*Cell membrane* controls the movement of substances into and out of cell.
One way of **passive** transport is diffusion
*Solutes and gases* can diffuse in and out

>  the *net movement* of *particles* from ==higher== concentration to ==lower== concentration due to *random movement*.
> *Net movement*: average or overall movement
## Osmosis
*definition*: the diffusion of ==water== molecules from **high water potential** to **low water potential** across a *partially-permeable membrane*.

## Active transport
*definition*: movement of molecules or ions **through a cell membrane** from a region of *lower* concentration *to higher concentration* (against the concentration gradient) **using energy from respiration.**
**Protein Carrier**: With the help of *ATP*(*Energy*), it will change shape.
