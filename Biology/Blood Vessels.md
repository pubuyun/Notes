## Artery

> Send blood leaves heart

Carry blood with *high pressure* and *strong force*

#### Characteristics

* Strong, thick, muscular walls to withstand the pressure
* Blood pulses through the arteries so they have elastic tissue that can stretch to make the flow smoother

## Capillary

> Arteries divide again and again

Capillaries are *very small* and *penetrate* to every part of the body
No cell is very far away from a capillary

#### Functions

* Take nutrients and oxygen to all the cells
* Take away waste materials

#### Characteristics

* Wall is one cell thick
* very small *lumen* $7\mu m$

## Vein

> Return blood to the heart

*Much lower pressure* than it was in the arteries.
Blood flows more slowly and smoothly.

#### Characteristic

* No need for thick, strong walls: thin layer of muscle, thin wall
* Wider, larger *lumen*
* *Valves* to ensure one-way flow

| Blood Vessel | Function                                      | Structure of wall           | Width of Lumen | Special Characteristics               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Artery       | Carry blood away from the heart               | Strong, thick muscular wall | small          | Pulses when heart beats               |
| Capillary    | take nutrients and oxygen in, take wastes out | one cell                    | very small     | Reaches almost everywhere in the body |
| Vein         | Return blood to the heart                     | thin layer of muscle        | wider          | Valves                                |

## Special Blood Vessels

### Kidney

entering: *renal artery*
leaving *renal vein*

### Liver

entering: *hepatic artery*
leaving: *hepatic vein*
**Leaving digestive system and entering the liver**: *hepatic portal vein*

> Brings nutrients

> \[!Note]
> Each organ, except the lungs, has an artery bringing in oxygen and a vein taking away waste
