> [!def] Photosynthesis
> The process by which plants *synthesize* from *inorganic raw materials* using energy from *sunlight*

> *Light* energy to *Chemical* energy

## Chlorophyll
> a green pigment found in *chloroplast*

$6CO_{2} +6H_{2}O\xrightarrow{\text{Light + Chloroplyll}}\ 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$

## Destinations
#### Glucose
> provide energy
> Cellular respiration to release energy
#### Starch
> insoluble so doesn't affect the concentration of solutions in the cell
#### Sucrose
> *disaccharide* made from 2 simple sugars
> *sucrose* is **carried** from one part to another and converted back to glucose at its destination.
#### Cellulose
> needed for cell walls.
> to make cell walls for new cells made during *growth* and regeneration
#### Nectar
> Some flowers produce sweet nectar for animals to feed on.
#### Amino acids
> $N$ comes from absorption, others comes from glucose.
> to make protein(enzymes)
#### Chlorophyll
> **not** a protein, but contains $N$, $Mg$
> *nitrate* ions $NO_{3}^-$ and *magnesium ions* $Mg^+$ are also essential.

## Factors affecting rate
> [!def] Limiting Factor
> A factor that is in *short supply*, which **stops** an activity happing at a faster rate

> If all resources are abundant and unlimited, the limiting factor will be the ability to photosynthesis and absorb materials.
> But most times, other factors are limiting factors
