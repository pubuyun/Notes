## Graph

- Use pencil
- Axes: X-axis is the lV, write an axis heading with IV and units clearly stated; Y-axis is the DV, write an axis heading with DV and **units** clearly stated.
- Scale: doesn't have to start from zero, as long as it's **even Plot**: plot data points with a small *X* or a dot with a small circle
- Line:*Connect* the dots with *straight line* or smooth curve Line of best fit (can be a curve, be careful **not to extrapolate**)
