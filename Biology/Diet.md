## Carbohydrates
### Source
Starch and sugar
### Function
Respiration needs carbohydrates

---
## Fats and oils
### Source
> *Saturated(饱和) fat*: **animal** fats - meat, butter, cheese
> *Unsaturated fat*: **plant** oils
### Function
energy store, making cell membranes, insulation, protect organs

---
## Proteins
### Source
meat, fish, egg, beans, nuts
### Function
build new cells , growth, make antibodies, hemoglobin, enzymes, hormones

---
## Water
**Solvent**

--- 
## Fiber
> Keep the *digestive system* work properly
> Soft foods without fibers do not stimulate the muscles in the intestines(肠道) Peristalsis(蠕动)^[muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system]
> prevents ***constipation***
#### Source: 
All plant foods contain fiber: cellulose cell walls. Humans cannot digest cellulose.
wholemeal bread, celery, oats, apple

--- 
## Minerals
### Calcium
#### Source
Milk and diary products
#### Function
For *bones and teeth*
for *blood clotting*
#### Deficiency
*Brittle* bones and teeth
*poor* blood clotting

### Iron
#### Source
Liver, red meat, egg yolk, dark green vegetables
#### Function
making *hemoglobin* in red blood cells
#### Deficiency
*Anemia*: lack of red blood cells

---
## Vitamin
### Vitamin C
#### Source
Citrus fruits, raw vegetables
#### Function
Strengthens immune system
make connective tissues
repairs tissues
#### Deficiency
**Scurvy**: Pain in joints, bleeding from gums

### Vitamin D
#### Source
Butter, egg yolk, vitamin D made by skin when sunlight falls
#### Function
*Helps* calcium to be absorbed
#### Deficiency
> **Rickets**: Bones becomes soft and deformed (佝偻病)
> Common in children in industrial areas, **who rarely got sunshine**
