## What is Cells?
Building blocks of life
**unicellular** only one cell
**multicellular** many types of cells
## Facts
All living thing are made up of cells
Smallest working units
==come from preexisting cells through cell division== (细胞分裂)

## Prokaryotic and eukaryotes
Nucleus (细胞核)
==EU== true/real
==PRO== original/pre-

## organelles and organism
**organelles** is structure in cell and **organism** is made up of cells
## eukaryotes
Contain organelles surrounded by membranes
Animal and Plant Cells
## Structures

  **Cell Membrane** (细胞膜)

1. outer membrane of cell -> **separates** a cell from surroundings
2. Controls things in and out of cells
3. keeps contents of cell inside.
> **cell wall** -> 细胞壁

  **Nucleus**

1. Contains DNA
2. Directs cell activities
3. Has a nuclear membrane


  **Chromosomes** (染色体)

1. In nucleus
2. Made of DNA
3. Contain instructions for traits and characteristics


  **Cytoplasm** (细胞质)

1. Contains of things like water, solution and organelles.


- **Mitochondria** (线粒体)

1. Produce energy through chemical reactions
2. **Folds** create lots of surface area for reactions


  **Ribosome** (核糖体)

1. Contains thousands of them
2. **make proteins** by **translating RNA codes**


  **Cell Wall**
  
1. Only for support, not selecting

  **Cell Chloroplast (叶绿体)**

1. Not all plants have them
2. Contains **chlorophyll** (叶绿素)


  **Large Vacuole**(液泡)

1. Store liquid
2. Helps plants maintain shape


## Prokaryotic cell
## Structure

- **Cell Wall**
	1. made of ==peptidoglycan==, not cellulose (肽聚糖, 纤维素)

- **plasma membrane**
- **Circular DNA**
	 1. instead of *chromosomes*, also called **nucleoid**

- **Plasmid**
	1. small circles of DNA
	2. can be exchanged between bacteria

- **Cytoplasm**
- **Ribosomes**

## Specialised Cells

*why*: not all cells are identical
same features are found in most cells, most have a particular feature
