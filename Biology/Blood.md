## Plasma
> The liquid part of blood

Includes water, nutrition, waste products, mineral ions, dissolved gases, hormones

## Red Blood Cell
> Large number in the plasma

*Cytoplasm* containing *hemoglobin*(血红蛋白): a protein that contains iron, carries 4 oxygen
**Characteristics** small, round, biconcave(双凹面) shaped, **no nucleus**
**Function**: carry oxygen

## White Blood Cell
Fewer in number but larger in size
**Characteristics**: contains nucleus, a lot of *ribosomes* and *mitochondria*
**Function**: find and kill pathogens(病原体) and clean up dead body cells
*Disease*: low WBC count causes low ability to fight infections
HIV attacks white blood cells and immune system
#### Lymphocyte(淋巴细胞)
> recognize pathogens and *produce* **antibodies**
> have a round large nucleus that fills the cell
#### Phagocyte (吞噬细胞)
> recognize pathogens and *does* **phagocytosis**

*Phagocytosis* -> engulfing(swallowing) and digesting pathogens
have a lobed(裂的) nucleus
## Platelets
**Characteristics**: small fragments of cells with no nucleus
**Function**: *blood clotting* (stopping bleeding)
- Prevents pathogen entering
- Prevents too much blood loss
### Blood Clotting
Blood plasma contains a protein called *fibrinogen*(纤维蛋白原) (soluble)
When a blood vessel is broken, platelets releases a substance(blood clotting factors 凝血因子) that change fibrinogen to *fibrin*(纤维蛋白) (insoluble)
Fibrin forms fibers that make a *mesh-like* structure to seal the wound
*Blood* clot forms with:
- A net of fibrin
- Trapped RBC in the net
- Platelets sticking together
