## Enzymes
> [!def]
> biological *catalysts*^[catalysts: a substance that *speeds up* a chemical reaction, or *lowers the temperature* or *pressure needed* to start one, *without* itself being consumed during the reaction.]

## Functions
### Speed up metabolic reactions
### Lowers activation energy
----------------------------
> *All* metabolic reactions need enzymes.

### Names

> Lipid *lipase*
> Maltase *maltase*
> Sucrose *sucrase*

reactant                                                                     product

> [!def] Substrate(Reactant)
> A substance on which an enzyme reacts

> [!def] Enzyme-substrate complex
> What is formed when a enzyme and substrate bind

> [!def] Product
> The substance produced then a enzyme acts on a substance

> [!def] Active Site
> The part of the enzyme that binds when an enzyme act on a substrate


## Properties
*Specificity*: describes enzyme action, only specific substrates fit into a particular enzyme
*Lock and key*: one specific key(reactant) fits perfectly in a particular lock(enzymes). A model for how enzymes work
*Complementary*(互补): describes the shape of a specific substrate that fits into a specific enzyme.

## Activation Energy
> [!def] 
> The energy needed for the substrate to chemically change into products

*Enzymes lower the activation energy* of a reaction, so reactions can take place at lower temperatures.

At low temp, molecules have low kinetic energy and move slowly, less collision happens, so slower rate of reaction


## Factors affecting enzyme rates
- Temperature
- pH
- concentration
- pressure
- substrate concentration
All enzymes has a *optimum temperature/pH*, 

### TEMPERATURE
> kinetic energy of enzyme and substrate molecules increase 
> activation energy of the reaction can more readily be provided at a higher temperature
> frequency collisions
> formation of enzyme-substrate complexes increase
> rate of reaction increase

> lose its shape
> denatured
> active site is no longer complementary
> enzyme-substrate complexes cannot for
