## Carbohydrate
*elements*: $C$, $H$, $O$
### Function
> - **Quick energy**: *glucose* in animal; sucrose in plant
> - **Short-term storage**: *glycogen* in animal; *starch* in plant
> - **Structure**: *cellulose* in plant

### Notes
> **Simple**: Glucose(葡萄糖), Sucrose(table sugar)(蔗糖), Lactose(乳糖)
> **Complex**: Starch(淀粉), Glycogen(糖原), Cellulose(纤维素)

> [!Note]
> *Complex* carbohydrate are made from *simple* carbohydrate.
> *Glucose* is the monomer (subunit) of glycogen, cellulose, starch
> Complex carbohydrate are *insoluble*
> broken down by *enzymes* in organism

### Testing

> [!Starch]
> for ***Starch***: Reagent used: **Iodine solution** 
> (*blue black* for positive else *yellow brown*)

> [!glucose]
> for ***glucose*/*reducing sugar(还原糖)***: Reagent used: **Benedict's Solution**(copper (II) sulphate and the Cu2+ ions)  with **HEAT**
> (*brick red* for positive, *green&orange* for slightly positive, else *blue*) 

> [!warning]
> *glucose*: (葡萄糖)
> *glycogen*: (糖原)
> *glycerol*: (甘油)
## Fats
*elements*: $C$, $H$, $O$
### Function
> - Long-term Storage
> - Thermal insulation
> - Buoyancy for marine animals
> - Component of cell membrane

*Example* : triglyceride(甘油三酯) (1 glycerol ($C_{3}H_{8}O_{3}$), 3 fatty acids(脂肪酸))
Fat and oil are *insoluble*
-phobia : fear of something
### Testing
> [!Lipids]
> Ethanol Emulsion Test, Reagent used: *ethanol* and *water*
> 1. food sample is placed in a test tube with ethanol
> 2. test tube is shaken and the fat dissolves into the ethanol. Add water and shake
> 3. RESULT: *Cloudy* for Positive and *Transparent* for Negative
## Proteins
*elements*: $C$, $H$, $O$, $N$
### Function
> *Growth* and *repair* of tissues
> Transport: Part of RBC
> Protection: Part of immune system

**Example**:
> Enzymes(酶), antibody(抗体), insulin(胰岛素)

### Notes
> Proteins are made up of **amino acids**(氨基酸) (*20* different types of amino acid)

### Tests
> [!Proteins]
> Reagent used: *Biuret Solution* 
> *purple* for Positive and *blue* for **Negative**

> [!Vitamin C]
> Reagent used: DCPIP Solution
> Add food juice into DCPIIP
> *Transparent* for Positive and *blue* for Negative
> 
> This reaction is a redox reaction: vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is oxidized to [dehydroascorbic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydroascorbic_acid "Dehydroascorbic acid"), and DCPIP is reduced to the colorless compound DCPIPH2
> DCPIP (blue) + H+ → DCPIPH (pink)
> DCPIPH (pink) + vitamin C → DCPIPH2 (colorless)

## Water

> [!Note]
> **solvent**
> essential for *digestion* to provide a medium for enzymes to *act in*
> transport *solutes* around the body and transport *waste* products to be excreted

## DNA
### Notes
Structure: *double helix*(双螺旋)
Subunit: *nucleotide*(核苷酸)
Three components of a nucleotide:
- sugar - *deoxyribose*(脱氧核糖) ($H−(C=O)−(CH_{2})−(CHOH)_{3}−H$)
- phosphate(磷酸盐)
- base
### Sugar + phosphate
> Sugar phosphate backbone (糖-磷酸骨架)
### Bases
*base sequence* makes up genes, which code for proteins
Function: **storing, coding and transferring** biological information though its unique structure.
Four types: *A, T, C, G*
Base pairing: <span class="greenf">A to T</span>, <span class='redf'>C to G</span>, complementary(互补)
Example: ATTCGCTA - TAAGCGAT
