> The loss of water vapor from leaves
### Advantages
> creates ***transpiration pull*** at the top of xylem vessel;
> stomata needs to be *open* to allow gas exchange
### Disadvantage
> losing water as a reactant of photosynthesis

> [!def] transpiration pull 
> A force produced by the loss of water vapor from a leaf because of the pressure difference between roots and leaves

### Wilting
> [!def] Wilting
> occurs then rate of transpiration > rate of water uptake

> Plant lose more water than gain
> not turgid, flaccid
## Transpiration pull
1.  Water molecules  are *cohesion* and *adhesion* -> forces of attraction between water molecules
2.  Water moves upwards in the xylem against gravity in a continuous column
3.  evaporation/diffusion of water at -> a pressure difference ->  pressure at xylem in roots -> pressure at xylem in leaves ->  constantly moves upwards
## Factors
### Light Intensity
> $\uparrow$Light Intensity -> $\uparrow$Photosynthesis -> $\uparrow CO_{2}$ in, $\uparrow O_{2}$ out -> $\uparrow$Stomata open -> $\uparrow$water diffusing out ->$\uparrow$transpiration

### Temperature
> $\uparrow$Temperature -> $\uparrow$Particles diffusion rate, $\uparrow$Air Capacity to hold water vapor -> $\uparrow$Evaporation rate ->  $\uparrow$rate of transpiration
> Until a certain temperature, plant dies

### Wind Speed

>  $\uparrow$Wind Speed -> moves away the water particles surrounding the leaf ->  $\uparrow$concentration gradient ->  $\uparrow$rate of transpiration

## Translocation
> [!def] 
> Movement of sucrose and amino acids in the phloem from sources to sinks

> ==Source== (光合产物的源)
> Part of the plant that releases sucrose or amino acids to be transported to other parts

> ==Sink== (光合产物消耗或储藏部位)
> part of the plant to which sucrose or amino acids are being transported, and where they are used or stored
