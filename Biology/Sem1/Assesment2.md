## Diffusion
- Definition
- Factors affecting diffusion rate: temp, concentration diff, 
## Osmosis
- Definition: water goes through a half-permeable membrane from higher water potential to lower water potential
- Water potential vs Concentration
- words to describe animal or plant cells when they gain or lose water(exp. burst) **TODO**
- 
## Active Transport
- Definition: using energy from respiration to let molecules moving against concentration gradient.
- Examples: 
- - Animals -> small intestine absorption(小肠吸收)
- - Plants -> root hair absorbing mineral ions
# Topic 4
## Carbohydrates
- Elements C H O
- Functions(3) 1. quick energy 2. short-term storage 3. support(plant)
- Examples(glucose, starch, etc.) Simple: glucose, Complex: starch, glycogen
- Monomers/Subunit: glucose
- Food tests -> starch, reducing sugar (reagent, result) reagent:iodine solution res: pos-blue black neg-yellow brown           sugar: reagent: Benedict's solution. res:  pos-brick red-orange-green neg-blue
## Lipids
- Element C H O
- Functions Long-term storage, 
- Example -> triglyceride (also subunits) subunit: glycerol, fatty acids.
- Food test - ethanol and water, res: pos-cloudy neg-transparent
## Proteins
- Element: N C H O
- Monomer is amino acid (氨基酸) 24 types
- Examples(Enzyme, hormone, antibody) 
- Food test(Biuret test) pos-purple neg-blue

## Water
- Functions(3)
- transport soluble molecules
- 

## DNA
- Monomer -> amino acid
- Three components of nucleotide -> (sugar, phosphate, base) 
- Structure of DNA -> double helix, complementary base pairing
- Base pairing (A to T, C to G)
