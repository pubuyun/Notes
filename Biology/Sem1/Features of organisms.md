## Nutrition
*-trophic* describes sources of nutrition
> **Autotrophic**: able to make their own nutrition from inorganic substances
> **Heterotrophic** : take in organic substances

## Animal
--------------
### Chordata 脊索动物门
#### Fish
- *scaly* skin (鳞片)
- *gills* throughout life (鳃)
- *fins* (鳍)
- eggs are laid in water and have no shells
#### Amphibians (两栖动物)
- *Metamorphosis* - tadpoles and adults (变态发育)
- No *scales*
- Eggs are laid in water and have no shells
- *tadpoles*(蝌蚪) have gills; adults have lungs/skin to breath;
#### Reptiles (爬行动物)
- *dry* scales
- eggs *dry* scales
- crawl/climb
#### Birds
- *Feathers*
- *wings* : most can fly
- *beak*: adapted to food source
- eggs with shells
#### Mammals
- *Fur/hair* (毛皮, 头发)
- *Mammary glands* (乳腺)
- Different types of teeth
- Yong is developed in *uterus.* (胎生)
- *Diaphragm*, *pinna*, and *sweat glands.* (横膈膜 耳廓 汗腺)
----------------
### Arthropoda 节肢动物
> - Invertebrates (not for all)
> - **jointed legs**
> - *waterproof **exoskeleton*** that supports their bodies
> - **segmented body**
#### Crustacean (甲壳纲)
- hard shell
- *aquatic*(水生) - gills
- *claws*, more than 4 pairs of legs
- *2* pairs of antennae
- examples include *lobsters, shrimps, crabs*
#### Myriapods (多足纲)
- legs on **each** segment
- flexible body in many segments
- have *antennae* (触角)
#### Arachnids  (蛛形纲)
- 4 pairs of legs
- segmented body - head and thorax(头, 胸)
- more than one set of eyes
- examples: *spiders, scorpions*
#### Insects (昆虫纲)
- *3* pairs of *jointed legs*
- *2* pairs of *wings*                                                                                                                                 (one or both may be vestigial^[a sturcture has evolved to be so small that it is no longer useful])
- *1* pair of *antennae* (触角)
- body is divided into head, thorax and abdomen (头，胸，腹)
- some insects can live in very dry places
-----------
## Fungi

> - Can be multicellular or unicellular
> - Contains cell wall, but made of *chitin*(甲壳素)
> - Made of a network of *microscopic fibers*(纤维): a *mycelium of **hyphae***
> 	- made from many cells joined end to end
> - Nutrition: **saprophytic***(腐生) - feed on decaying organic matter
> 	- No chlorophyll, so **no photosynthesis**
> 	- ==Decomposers==: break down waste materials and dead organisms (分解者)
> - Reproduction: ***spores***(孢子) - spread by wind or animals
> - *A few types of fungi have structures comparable to bacterial plasmids (loops of DNA).*

*yeast* : 酵母菌
*mold*: 霉菌
*penicillin*: 青霉素

-----------
## Plants

> - contain ***chlorophyll***
> - have a nucleus and cell walls are made of cellulose
> - **multicellular**
> - get nutrition from photosynthesis: autotroph
#### Ferns (蕨类植物)
- leaves of ferns are called *fronds*(叶状体)
- flowerless
- reproduce by *spores* produced on the underside of fronds

#### Flowering plants
- roots, stems, leaves
- reproduce using flowers and seeds
- seeds are produced in an *ovary*(子房) in the flower.
##### Dicotyledons, aka dicots (双子叶植物)
- seed with two *cotyledons*(两个子叶)
- *flower petals*(花瓣) in multiples of **4 or 5** 
- *vascular bundles* in the stem in a *ring* (茎内维管束呈环状)
- *leaf veins*(叶脉) are in network
- main root and other roots

##### Monocotyledons, aka monocots (单子叶植物)
- seeds with one *cotyledon*
- *flower petals* in multiples of **3**
- vascular bundles arranged *randomly* in the stem
- *leaf veins* are parallel
- *branching* root

|                  | Monocotyledons   | Dicotyledons        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| cotyledons       | 1                | 2                   |
| flower petals    | multiple of 3    | multiple of 4 or 5  |
| vascular bundles | randomly in stem | in a ring           |
| leaf veins       | parrallel        | network             |
| root             | branching root   | main root and other |

## Protist (原生生物) 
> - a mixed collection of organisms
> 	- animal like cells and plant like cells
> 	- mostly unicellular
> - **Eukaryotic** organisms that don't belong in animals, plants, or fungi
> - Examples: paramecium, seaweed, amoeba

## Prokaryotes
> - Unicellular
> - **Prokaryotic** cells: no nucleus,  but nucleoid
> 	- Circular DNA(chromosome) 染色体, often have plasmids(质粒)
> 	- cell wall made from *peptidoglycan*(肽聚糖)
> 		- No mitochondria: nutrition from light or organic(有机的) substance
> 	- Some have *flagella*(鞭毛) for movement, *capsule*(荚膜), chlorophyll*
> - examples: *E. coli, Streptococcus*(大肠杆菌， 链球菌)

## Virus (Not a kingdom)
> *it was a debate whether viruses are living organisms or not*
> Viruses have a ***protein coat*** and ***genetic material*** inside
> **Acellular** (not a cell)

## Adaptive Feature
> [!def] 
> Adaptive features are the inherited functional features of an organism that increase its fitness.
