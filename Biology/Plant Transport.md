## Xylem 
> [!def]
> transports *water* and *dissolved mineral ions*; provide **support**; 

> Substances goes **UP**.
### Structure
> Cell wall is *thick* and contains *lignin*(木质素) : **Support**
> **Dead, empty** cells with no cell content : **water can flow easily**
> No cross walls, cells are joined end to end : **Continuous for water to flow through**
> diameter: 15-200 *micrometers*($\mu m$) : **Capillary action**

## Phloem
> [!def] 
> transports *sucrose* and *amino acids*

> Substances go **DOWN**/**up** 
> transport of sugar is called *translocation*
### Structure
> Cells are *alive* but *lack some organelles*
> *Sieve cells* with *sieve plates* - holes on cross walls instead of hollow

### Root

### Stem
![[Pasted image 20241120103359.png|300]]
### Leaf
> **Xylem** towards *upper epidermis*
> **Phloem** towards *lower epidermis*

## Water Uptake
### Root tip
> **Root cap** at the tip for *protective purposes* as it grows through the soil
> *Epidermis layer* has specialized cells called root hair cells 
> Root hairs do not live for very long: replacement

### Pathway of water
*Soil* -> 
*Root hair cell* -> 
*Root cortex* -> 
*Xylem vessel* in **root**, **stem**, **leaf** -> 
*Mesophyll cell*
