## Physical Digestion
- Breaking large pieces into smaller soluble pieces
-Â Increase _surface area_ for enzymes to act on
- *teeth, stomach*
### Teeth
#### Incisors
*chisel* shaped, In the front middle
**Function**: bite off pieces of food
#### Canines
similar to incisors for human, more *pointed* for carnivores
**Function**: killing preys (carnivores), bite (human)
#### Premolars and Molars
*wide surfaces, broad*, towards the back of the mouth
**Function**: *grinding* food to increase its surface area
Premolar has *1* root, Molar has *2* roots
#### Structure

**Enamel**: strong material, covers the surface
- *Hardest* substance made by animals
- Can be dissolved by acids and can feed bacteria if dirty
- *Tooth decay*: bacteria form plaque; breaking down of sugar releases *acid*.
**Dentine**: living tissue
**Pulp**: contains nerves and blood vessels
**Cement**: holds tooth in the gum
### Bile
Neutralize acidic mixture
*Emulsifies* fat into tiny droplets of liquid

## Chemical Digestion
### Starch
1. *amylase*: (starch into maltose) 
	- by **salivary glands**, *pancreas*
	- acts in **mouth**, *duodenum*
2. *maltase* (maltose into glucose)
	- By **epithelial cells** of duodenum
	- acts in duodenum
> Starch -> *glucose*
### Protein
1. *pepsin* (optimum pH 2)
	- by stomach
2. *trypsin* (optimum pH 7-8)
	- by pancreas
	- acts in duodenum
> Protein -> *amino acids*

### Lipid
1. *lipase*
	- by pancreatic juice
	- acts in duodenum
> Lipid -> *fatty acid, glycerol*
