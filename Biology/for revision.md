## Nutrition
*-trophic* describes sources of nutrition
> **Autotrophic**: able to make their own nutrition from inorganic substances
> **Heterotrophic** : take in organic substances

## Animal
--------------
### Chordata 有脊椎动物
#### Fish
- scaly skin
- fins
- *gills*
- lay egg in water, no protection(*shell*)
#### Amphibians (两栖动物)
- 变态发育 *Metamorphosis*
- *no scales*(鳞片)
- has lung, skin can assist breathing ( *tadpoles*(蝌蚪) have *gills*; *adults* have lungs/skin to breath;)
- lay egg in water

#### Reptiles (爬行动物)
- 甲壳 *dry* scales
- <del>has lung</del>
- *crawl/climb*
- lay egg on land, with protection(*shell*)

#### Birds
- wings, most can fly
- feather
- lung, 气囊(*air sac*)
- *beak*: adapted to food source

#### Mammals
- fur, hair(毛发)
- 胎生 (*has uterus*)
- *Different types of teeth*
- *Mammary glands* (乳腺)
- *Diaphragm*, *pinna*, and *sweat glands.* (横膈膜 耳廓 汗腺)
----------------
### Arthropoda 节肢动物
- jointed legs
- exoskeleton
- segmented body

#### Crustacean (甲壳纲)
- hard shell
- aquatic (have gills)
- claws, *more than 4 pairs of legs*
#### Myriapods (多足纲)
a pair of leg in each segment of body
flexible body with many segments
has antennae

#### Arachnids  (蛛形纲)
4 pairs of legs
more than 1 pair of eyes
2 part of segmented body

#### Insects (昆虫纲)
3 pairs of legs
2 pairs of wing
1 pair of antennae


-----------
### Fungi

> - Can be multicellular or unicellular
> - Contains cell wall, but made of *chitin*(甲壳素)
> - Made of a network of *microscopic fibers*(纤维): a *mycelium of hyphae*
> 	- made from many cells joined end to end
> - Nutrition: **saprophytic***(腐生) - feed on decaying organic matter
> 	- No chlorophyll, so **no photosynthesis**
> 	- ==Decomposers==: break down waste materials and dead organisms (分解者)
> - Reproduction: ***spores***(孢子) - spread by wind or animals

*yeast* : 酵母菌
*mold*: 霉菌
*penicillin*: 青霉素

-----------
### Plants

> - contain ***chlorophyll***
> - have a nucleus and cell walls are made of cellulose
> - get nutrition from photosynthesis: autotroph
#### Ferns (蕨类植物)
- leaves of ferns are called *fronds*(叶状体)
- flowerless
- reproduce by *spores* produced on the underside of fronds

#### Flowering plants
- roots, stems, leaves
- reproduce using flowers and seeds
- seeds are produced in an *ovary*(子房) in the flower.
##### Dicotyledons, aka dicots (双子叶植物)
- seed with two *cotyledons*(两个子叶)
- *flower petals*(花瓣) in multiples of 4 or 5
- *vascular bundles* in the stem in a *ring* (茎内维管束呈环状)
- *leaf veins*(叶脉) are in network
- main root and other roots

##### Monocotyledons, aka monocots (单子叶植物)
- seeds with one *cotyledon*
- *flower petals* in multiples of 3
- vascular bundles arranged *randomly* in the stem
- *leaf veins* are parallel
- *branching* root

|                  | Monocotyledons   | Dicotyledons        |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| cotyledons       | 1                | 2                   |
| flower petals    | multiple of 3    | multiple of 4 or 5  |
| vascular bundles | randomly in stem | in a ring           |
| leaf veins       | parrallel        | network             |
| root             | branching root   | main root and other |

## Protoctist (原生生物)
> - a mixed collection of organisms
> 	- animal like cells and plant like cells
> 	- mostly unicellular
> - **Eukaryotic** organisms that don't belong in animals, plants, or fungi
> - Examples: paramecium, seaweed, amoeba

## Prokaryotes
> - Unicellular
> - **Prokaryotic** cells: no nucleus,  but nucleoid
> 	- Circular DNA(chromosome) 染色体, often have plasmids(质粒)
> 	- cell wall made from *peptidoglycan*(肽聚糖)
> 		- No mitochondria: nutrition from light or organic(有机的) substance
> 	- Some have *flagella*(鞭毛) for movement, *capsule*(荚膜), chlorophyll*
> - examples: *E. coli, Streptococcus*(大肠杆菌， 链球菌)

## Virus (Not a kingdom)
> *it was a debate whether viruses are living organisms or not*
> Viruses have a protein coat and genetic material inside
> **Acellular** (not a cell)
