## Ingestion
---
> I for in

> [!def]
> Taking food into the body
#### Mouth
> Teeth, lips, and tongue
> Both *physical* and *chemical* digestion
#### Salivary Gland (唾液腺)
> Make *saliva* - water, mucus, amylase
> *chemical* digestion
#### Oesophagus (食管)
> Tube connecting mouth to stomach

**Peristalsis**(蠕动) of muscles to move the food down: *physical* digestion
Has a *sphincter muscle*(括约肌) where it connects to the stomach
*Trachea*(气管): airway that connects mouth to lungs
## Digestion
---
> [!def]
> Breaking large insoluble molecules into small soluble molecules
### Physical Digestion
Biting, chewing grinding, cutting, emulsifying
### Chemical Digestion
Enzymes, acids
#### Stomach
> Strong, **muscular** walls for **mixing** the food with *enzymes* and *mucus* and **storing** food for a few hours

 *sphincter muscles* both at the top and bottom of stomach; relax to let food through
 *Stomach cells* produce: *Mucus*, *Enzymes: protease*, *Hydrochloric acid*: low pH to kill bacteria
 Both *physical* and *chemical* digestion
#### Small Intestine - Duodenum
> Next stop from stomach

*Pancreatic juice*(胰液) and *bile*(胆汁) are released by different organs into the duodenum
Contains *enzymes*:, 
**alkaline** to neutralise
 Both *physical* and *chemical* digestion
#### Liver and Gall Bladder
> Liver *produces* bile, and gall bladder *stores* bile

bile is released into duodenum through a tube called *bile duct*
bile *neutralizes* the acidic mixture from stomach
also helps with *physical* digestion

#### Pancreas
> Pancreas makes enzymes - *lipase, protease, amylase* that are released into duodenum

*chemical* digestion
## Absorption
---
> [!def]
> Movement of small soluble molecules and mineral ions from small intestines into the blood

Through *Diffusion*, then *Active Transport*
#### Small Intestine - ileum
> between duodenum and large intestine
> *Absorption* of broken-down nutrients and water into the blood


## Assimilation
---
> [!def]
> Nutrients are absorbed by *individual cells* and become part of the body
## Egestion
---
> E for exit

> [!def]
> Fiber and other undigested, unabsorbed materials remain in the intestines and are egested

#### Large Intestine - Colon and Rectum
> *Colon* absorbs water and minerals (less than ileum)
> *Rectum* stores undigested food as feces
> Egestion happens through the anus
## Alimentary Canal
> A pathway or a track tat food passes through
> contains *muscles* that can do **peristalsis**
> Secretes **mucus**(粘液) form *goblet* cells
## Accessory Organs
> Food doesn't pass through them
> they make essential **digestive enzymes**
