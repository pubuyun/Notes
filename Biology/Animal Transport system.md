## Circulatory systems

> \[!def]
> A system of blood vessels with a pump(heart) and valves to ensure one-way flow of blood

### Oxygenated vs Deoxygenated

> Oxygen diffuses into the blood from the lungs-> oxy blood
> travels to the heart to be pumped and delivered to the whole body
> Oxygen diffuses to body cells from the blood -> deoxy blood
> It travels to the heart to be pumped and delivered to the lungs to be oxygenated

> Double circulations of mammal (faster, higher efficiency)
> Single circulation of fish

## Heart

### Coronary heart disease
_Caused by CAD_: coronary atherosclerosis disease

#### Factors
> Air pollution, Genetics\
> Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, lack of exercise, and a poor diet
