## Measurement

> **instrument** -> decimal point -> accuracy, not s.n.
> **calculation** -> significant figures -> the same as before

#### to avoid parallax(视差) error

> reading need to be done at **eye level**
> eye must be **perpendicular** to the scale
> the bottom of the **meniscus**(液柱的弯月面)

## Significant figures

### Definition

> All non-zero digits are significant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
> Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 102, 2005, 50009
> Leading zeros are never significant: 0.02, 001.887, 0.000515.
> In a number *with* a decimal point, trailing zeros (those to the right of the last non-zero digit) **are significant**: 389.000; 2.02000, 20.0000(all 6 s.f.)
> *In G-level, answer should always have* ***2 or 3 s.f.***

### Calculations

> The result of a calculation should be expressed to the **minimum number** of significant figures used in the data for × and ÷ (or one more). (统一到有效数值最少数值)
> For + and - give the answer to the **fewest number** of decimal places(d.p.) (统一到最不精确数值)

## Drawing a Graph

### Each large box(10 little boxes) should be a multiple of 1, 2, or 5.

### Use at least half of the given space

### Triangle must be shown clearly with no extra marks on the line

*2*. draw the tangent of the curve on that point and calculate the gradient of the line.
*3*. B is proportional to a
*4*. False

$4\times10^3$ *four times ten to the (power of) three.*
