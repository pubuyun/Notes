## Speed and Velocity
*Speed*: does not depend on *direction*
*Velocity*: the *speed* and *direction*.
### Calculating
**Write this:**
$$\text{speed} = \frac{distance}{time}$$
**Instead of this:**
$$\bar{v} = \frac{s}{t} $$
$\text{gradient} = \text{velocity}$ in S-T graph
*Instantaneous speed*: gradient of S-T graph at one point
**In a V-T graph:** $a =\text{gradient}=\frac{v-u}{t}$,   $\text{Area under graph} = \text{distance}$

### Acceleration
*Definition*: the *rate* at which an object increases speed or velocity

*1*: True
*2*. velocity, acceleration
*3.* they must be touching each other 
*4*. C

*1*. it means that the object keeps stationary.
*2*. False
*3*. it moves at a constant speed from 0 sec. to 5 sec. ,deceleration from 5sec. to 10sec. stays after 10 sec., and start to move again in the 15th sec.
*4*. $\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{10\ m}{5\ s} = 2 \ m\cdot s^{-1}$
*5*. the gradient is speed.

*1*. the velocity doesn't change, $a=0$
*2*. a curve with decreasing gradient(negative).
*3*. first increase with same gradient, then keeps steady
*4*. $a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{40\ m-20\ m}{15\ s-10\ s}=4\ m\cdot s^{-2}$
*5.* ${TotalDistance} = {Area}$
