## Temperature
reflects the average [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of its constituent particles (atoms or molecules) relative to its center of mass.

### Kelvin K
$C\degree = K+273$
0K -> Absolute Zero

### Laws of gases
$$P\cdot V=nRT$$
where n, R is constant when mass is constant
## Kinetic Theory of Gases
> Molecules of a gas behave as identical (or all have the same mass)
> Molecules of gas are hard, perfectly elastic spheres
> The molecules are in continuous random motion
> There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between the molecules
> External forces (e.g. gravity) are ignored
> Newton's laws apply
> The volume of the molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container
> The molecules collide perfectly elastically with the walls of the container exerting a pressure upon them
> The time of a collision is negligible compared to the time between collisions
> There are a very large number of molecules 

- Pressure in a gas is caused by the collisions of particles with the walls of the container
- When the particles travel **faster** (e.g. at a higher temperature), they collide with walls **more frequently**
    - This means the gas exerts a **greater pressure**
