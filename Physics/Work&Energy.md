$$W = \Delta E = F \cdot d$$
## Types of energy
### Gravitational Potential Energy
$$GPE = mgh$$
### Kinetic Energy
$$K_{E} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
## Conservation of Energy
> [!def] 
> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one from into another
### Energy transfer
#### Sankey diagram
> Transferred to the **surroundings** as heat and sound.
