## Newton's laws of motion
> [!def]
> 1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, except insofar as it is acted upon by a force.
> 2. At any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration "Acceleration") multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum") is changing with time.
>  $$F = ma = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
> 3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

#### _For Newton's third law_
_force must be_:
- same type
- act in the same plane but opposite directions
- act on different objects

## Reaction time and distance
#### factors that affect reaction time
- tiredness
- alcohol/drug use
- _any factor that may delay the interpretation of the driver of imminent danger_
#### Factor that affect reaction distance
- reaction time
- velocity
- *any factor that may affect time and force*

*1.* vector has directions while scalar doesn't.
*2*. they interacted by force
*3*. According to Newton's Third Law,  _for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction_.
*4*. Gravitational force
*5*. $200N$, up.

1. making it be two forces added together, usually two perpendicular force.
2. all the force adding together is 0
3. C
4. $F_{R} = |F_{1}+F_{2}| = 5$
5. east
