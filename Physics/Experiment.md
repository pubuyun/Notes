## Variables
1. **independent**: *diameter*
2. **dependent**: *depth* of the hole
3. **control**: *height* of drop, balls of the same *material*
## Materials
> boss
> stand
> clamp
> ramp
> meter rule
> ray with sand

## Method
1. Prepare the set-up as in the diagram
2. Measure the diameter of a ball
3. Put the ball at the top of the ramp and let it go
4. use a meter rule to measure the depth of the hole
5. repeat steps 3 and 4, at least three times and take average (make sure to level the sand before to a new drop)
6. repeat steps 1 to 5 by using 4 more balls of different size
## Data table

| ball number | diameter/cm | hole depth1/cm | hole depth2/cm | hole depth3/cm | hole depth avr/cm |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1           |             |                |                |                |                   |
| 2           |             |                |                |                |                   |
| 3           |             |                |                |                |                   |
| 4           |             |                |                |                |                   |
| 5           |             |                |                |                |                   |

## Safety
> wear safety goggles
> wear closed toe shoes

## Conclusion
> **By comparing the data from the table** if the range changes with the angle then I can *conclude* that the [D.V.] changes with [I.V.]
