$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
Unit: Pascal - $N\cdot m^{-2}$
## Solids
### Examples
1. Increase the pressure by *Reducing* the area
	- knife, needle
2. Reduce the pressure by *increasing* the area
	- skis, wall foundations
## Gases
$a.t.m.$ -> atmosphere pressure 100kPa
When goes up:
> 	Smaller column of air above us
> 	Air will be less dense



## Liquids
$$P = \rho gh$$
ressure at the **same** depth acts **equally** in all directions
> Floating force: difference of pressure
