$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
Unit: Pascal - $N\cdot m^{-2}$
## Solids
### Examples
1. Increase the pressure by *Reducing* the area
	- knife, needle
2. Reduce the pressure by *increasing* the area
	- skis, wall foundations
## Gases
$a.t.m.$ -> atmosphere pressure 100kPa
When goes up:
> 	Smaller column of air above us
> 	Air will be less dense

### Laws of gases
$$P\cdot V=nRT$$
where n, R is constant when mass is constant
## kinetic theory of gases
> Molecules of a gas behave as identical (or all have the same mass)
> Molecules of gas are hard, perfectly elastic spheres
> The molecules are in continuous random motion
> There are no forces of attraction or repulsion between the molecules
> External forces (e.g. gravity) are ignored
> Newton's laws apply
> The volume of the molecules is negligible compared to the volume of the container
> The molecules collide perfectly elastically with the walls of the container exerting a pressure upon them
> The time of a collision is negligible compared to the time between collisions
> There are a very large number of molecules 

## Liquids
$$P = \rho gh$$
## Temperature
### Celsius CÂ°
### Kelvin K
$C\degree = K+273$
0K -> Absolute Zero
